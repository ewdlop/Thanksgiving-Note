Here's a humorous twist on Thanksgiving with a philosophical edge:

---

The turkey’s had enough. Year after year, it’s been the main course, sacrificed for the sake of holiday tradition. This year, the turkey decides it’s time to make a stand—and calls upon none other than Aristotle himself, summoning him *from the depths* for some moral backup.

"Aristotle!" the turkey bellows, "Is it not unjust that I, a noble bird, am doomed to be roasted every Thanksgiving?"

Aristotle, appearing in a puff of philosophical smoke, scratches his beard and nods thoughtfully. "Indeed, it raises questions of virtue and ethics. Perhaps the humans should reflect upon *their own appetites*."

Encouraged, the turkey continues, “Aren’t there virtues in *not* eating the guest of honor?”

Aristotle sighs, "My dear turkey, humans seem to lack moderation this time of year, and what you suffer is the ultimate consequence of *their overindulgence.* However, maybe we could suggest an alternative feast?"

"Yes!" the turkey exclaims, "How about a feast of… broccoli?"

Aristotle strokes his beard. "Broccoli might suffice… but I fear they’ll just add cheese. Humans are quite the gluttonous creatures."

In the end, the turkey and Aristotle work out a plan to lobby for more plant-based Thanksgivings. Whether or not it will catch on remains to be seen, but the turkey is thankful to have philosophy on its side, at least for one more year.

It’s a humorous thought—if turkeys had philosophers backing them up, Thanksgiving might look a little different!
